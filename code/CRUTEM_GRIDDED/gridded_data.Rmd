## Lesson 1

We are now looking at gridded data .This is another way climatological
data can be provided. As the name suggests the data is provided onto
regular grids.

So far what we were doing was reanalysis. So we will need to reproduce
climatilogical features of reanalysis fields in the past

This time our focus will not be globally but only over a selected grid

After that we are going to run the same analysis we run on the previous
excertation

After that we are going to consinder any other data sets which can be
downloaded from the Copernicus Climate Data Store

https :://cds climate copernicus eu/#!/ home

for now lets download our data from

https :://crudata uea ac uk/cru/data/temperature

The file is

CRUTEM5, netCDF

https :://cds climate copernicus eu/#!/ home

so lets define the path

```{R}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(error = TRUE)# iignore this line its just for an error
#am getting when creating the document 
```

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
path1 <- "C:/Users/VICTOR_NYABUTI/Climate/climate_change_global_adaptation/data/CRUTEM_GRIDDED/"
path3 <- "c:/Users/VICTOR_NYABUTI/Climate/climate_change_global_adaptation/output/tables/"
```

Then install all packages we need

```{r}
#install.packages("ncdf4","lubridate"  )
```

which are responsible for raeding ncdf files and for finding leap years
respetively

Now lets load them

```{r}
library(ncdf4)
library(lubridate)
```

open the file by allocating it to a variable *nc*. we use the function
**paste**

```{r}
nc <- nc_open(paste(path1,"HadCRUT.5.0.1.0.anomalies.ensemble_mean.nc",sep=""))

```

inspect the variable

```{r}
nc
```

Lets have a closer look at this data. The values we are intrested in
are: **Variables** we have a total of 6 **Units** In kelvins **time** in
days since 1850-01-01 00:00:00 **latitude and long** 36 N 72 E **Glbal
attributes** that give a bit more information on the whole thing it says
that we have 2m air temp ovróer land blennded withs ea water temparature
at a depth of 20cm

Lets extract this values so that we can work on the data. we need
variables like the temperature means,longitude, latitude and even time .
we use the function **ncvar_get()**

```{R}
data <-  ncvar_get(nc,"tas_mean") #where we get a 3 dimensional matrix 
```

lets extract time,longitude and latitude

```{R}
longitude <- ncvar_get(nc,"longitude") #Vector
latitude <- ncvar_get(nc,"latitude") #Vector
time <- ncvar_get(nc,"time") #Vector
longitude  # -177.5 177.5
latitude # -87.5 to 87.5
```

to get the number of months

```{R}
nmonth <- length(time)
```

This data is daily. We have leap and non leap years meaning that they do
not have the same number of days

```{r}
#Julian days for a non-leap years. The day in the mid of the month is considered
day <- c(15.5,45,74.5,105,135.5,166,196.5,227.5,258,288.5,319,349.5)
#Julian days for a leap years. The day in the mid of the month is considered
day_leap <- c(15.5,45.5,75.5,106,136.5,167,197.5,228.5,259,289.5,320,350.5)
```

We use the lubridate package that is necessary to find if a year is
leap. Bacially returns tru or false if the year is leap or non leap
repsectively from the very first year ti the very last year

```{R}
year_leap <- leap_year(1850:2022) #figure out which years are leap
start_year <- 1850
end_year <- 2022
years <- c(1850:2022) #all years in one variable
n_year <- end_year-start_year+1 # +1 ro include the very first year

summary(year_leap) #total number of leap ie True is 42
n_year #total number of the years
```

Now we would like to make a matrix that has the values of temperature

Before that please note the following

to say equal to in R we use = But to say same as we use **= =**  to say
and we use &\
to say or we use **\|**\
to say is not equal we use an exclamation mark **!**\

The breakdown of this code goes like this 

for **i** remember now that that our **i** is years

1.This years and from 1 :/to the *n_year* or last year\
if the year is 1 i.e the first year, do the following\
create a matrix and save it as a variable *day_sequence*ncol 3 nrow 12\
fill the first column with the values from years\
fill the second column with values 1,2,3, ...which are months\
if the year is not leap put values from the *day* variable in the 3rd
column\
if the year is leap put the values from *day_leap* in the 3rd column\
the number of days in anot leap year is 365\
the number of days in leap year are 366

After that we do the same thing but w ea re now not consindering the
first year see the usage of **!=**?

```{R}
for(i in 1:n_year){
  #if we are considering the first year
  if(i==1){
    day_sequence <- matrix(ncol=3,nrow=12)# empty matrix
    day_sequence[,1] <- years[i] #for column 1 put value of i from the years 
    #variable
    day_sequence[,2] <- c(1:12) # for column 2 put values in a sequence 1 
    #to 12 i.e 1,2,3...12
    if(year_leap[i]==FALSE) day_sequence[,3] <- day #If the year is not 
    #leap assighn it to variable day
    if(year_leap[i]==TRUE) day_sequence[,3] <- day_leap #If the year is leap 
    #assighn it to variable day_leap
    if(year_leap[i]==FALSE) count_day <- 365
    if(year_leap[i]==TRUE) count_day <- 366
  }
  #if we are not considering the first year
  if(i!=1){
    day_sequence_x <- matrix(ncol=3,nrow=12)
    day_sequence_x[,1] <- years[i]
    day_sequence_x[,2] <- c(1:12)
    if(year_leap[i]==FALSE) day_sequence_x[,3] <- day+count_day
    if(year_leap[i]==TRUE) day_sequence_x[,3] <- day_leap+count_day
    day_sequence <- rbind(day_sequence,day_sequence_x)
    if(year_leap[i]==FALSE) count_day <- count_day+365
    if(year_leap[i]==TRUE) count_day <- count_day+366
  } 
}

```

## Lesson 2

This data contains all the possible times from the beginning to the end
my it is not mandatory that all these times are present in our data

we create a vector names time_ok. If zou just run the variable **time**
you can see all possible times. From that varibale we define our new
vector time_ok.

```{R}
for(i in 1:length(time)){
  time_ok[i] <- which(time[i]==day_sequence[,3])
}
```

generally we are taking time_ok data from the 3rd column of the varibale
*day_sequence*

```{r}
day_sequence <- day_sequence[time_ok,]

```

Now the variable *day_sequence* has data just for the right period
*time_ok*

we do not need the last year 2022 because its incomplete.so we delete it

```{r}
day_sequence <- day_sequence[-which(day_sequence[,1]==2022),]

```

This matrix has data for all availlable grid points in time okay. But we
need to work on a specific grid. In class we selected france. To know
the right lat and lon, we need to go to google earth.

If you have a donloaded version of gooogle earth search an area in our
case france.Turn on the grids by going to the view \> check grids. i
have highlighted in yellow the grids section and also a place where you
can read in real time the coordinates of the area we are intrested in

```{r  echo=FALSE, fig.cap="A caption", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/VICTOR_NYABUTI/Climate/climate_change_global_adaptation/download.png")
```

sometimes when zooming in you might end up not see the grids clearlz so
it can be beneficial to turn off other layers at the lower left part of
the screen

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/VICTOR_NYABUTI/Climate/climate_change_global_adaptation/download1.png")
```

so lets inspect france. It comes lovely the area covered by this
coordinates

```{r}
#The matrix with the data includes the monthly values for all the available grid-points
#I cut a part and I calculate the monthly mean for the selected area
area_lon_min <- 5
area_lon_max <- 19
area_lat_min <- 35
area_lat_max <- 47


```

from our data lets search this area's data

```{r}
lat_selected <- which(latitude>=area_lat_min & latitude<=area_lat_max)
lon_selected <- which(longitude>=area_lon_min & longitude<=area_lon_max)

#Number of point included in the selected area
npoint_selected <- length(lat_selected)*length(lon_selected)
npoint_selected


#Coordinates of the selected from-points
grid_selected <- matrix(ncol=2,nrow=npoint_selected)#empty matrix
grid_selected


colnames(grid_selected) <- c("Latitude","Longitude") #renaming the columns 
grid_selected

#filling the matrix
ii <- 0
for(i in 1:length(lat_selected)){
  for(j in 1:length(lon_selected)){
    ii <- ii+1
    grid_selected[ii,"Latitude"] <- latitude[lat_selected[i]]
    grid_selected[ii,"Longitude"] <- longitude[lon_selected[j]]
  }
}


#check it out 
grid_selected

#exported the matrix as a table
write.table(grid_selected,paste(path3,"Grid_points_",area_lon_min,"_",
                                area_lon_max,"_",area_lat_min,"_",
                                area_lat_max,".csv",sep=""),sep=";",
            col.names=TRUE,row.names=FALSE,quote=FALSE)


#For each month I extract the temperature anomaly data of the selected area
# and I calculate the area mean
# 
temp_selected <- vector()#empty vector then we fill it
for(i in 1:length(day_sequence[,1])){
  time_ok <- which(time==day_sequence[i,3])
  data_selected <- data[lon_selected,lat_selected,time_ok]
  temp_selected[i] <- mean(data_selected,na.rm=TRUE)
}

#we can peak at it 
head(temp_selected)

#Now we bind/ add other data into the vector. we add day sequence 
temp_selected <- cbind(day_sequence,temp_selected)

#we can peak at it 
head(temp_selected)

#rename the columns

colnames(temp_selected) <- c("Year","Month","Julian_day","Mean")

#we can peak at it 
head(temp_selected)

#we expport it as a table 
write.table(temp_selected,paste(path3,"Temperature_anomaly_mean_",
                                area_lon_min,"_",area_lon_max,"_",area_lat_min,
                                "_",area_lat_max,".csv",
                                sep=""),,sep=";",col.names=TRUE,row.names=FALSE,
            quote=FALSE)

#export this data into a workable matrix
temp_matrix <- matrix(data=temp_selected[,"Mean"],ncol=12,nrow=(n_year-1),byrow=TRUE)
temp_matrix <- cbind((start_year:(end_year-1)),temp_matrix)
colnames(temp_matrix) <- c("Year","January","February","March","April","May","June","July","August","September","October","November","December")

write.table(temp_matrix,paste(path,"Monthly_temperature_anomaly_mean_matrix_",area_lon_min,"_",area_lon_max,"_",area_lat_min,"_",area_lat_max,".csv",sep=""),sep=";",col.names=TRUE,row.names=FALSE,quote=FALSE)
```

We now have data but instead of global the data is for a given area we
can now run analysis on the data just as we ddi from our earlier lessons

```{R}
knitr::purl()
```
