## 1. Run the temp anomaly analyses on our newly acquired Gridded data 


From the gridded exercise we generated data of our grid. So now we are going to
run some temperature trends analysis on this data.

As usual define the path where zou are going to get the data and also where you
will save the data.


```{R}
path1 = "C:/Users/VICTOR_NYABUTI/Climate/climate_change_global_adaptation/output/CRUTEM_GRIDDED/tables/"

path2 <- "C:/Users/VICTOR_NYABUTI/Climate/climate_change_global_adaptation/output/CRUTEM_GRIDDED/plots/" 


values = as.matrix(read.table(paste(path1,"Temperature_anomaly_mean_5_19_35_47.csv", sep=""), sep = ",",dec = "."))
                                    
head(values)

```

Now  lets transform this data into a workable table 

```{r}
temp_matrix <- matrix(data=temp_selected[,"Mean"],ncol=12,nrow=(n_year-1),byrow=TRUE)
temp_matrix <- cbind((start_year:(end_year-1)),temp_matrix)
colnames(temp_matrix) <- c("Year","January","February","March","April","May","June","July","August","September","October","November","December")

write.table(temp_matrix,paste(path,"Monthly_temperature_anomaly_mean_matrix_",area_lon_min,"_",area_lon_max,"_",area_lat_min,"_",area_lat_max,".csv",sep=""),sep=";",col.names=TRUE,row.names=FALSE,quote=FALSE)


```
